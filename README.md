# classifieds-system
This is a pet project to make a Classifieds ad System

## Technologies
I built this using TypeScript so as to teach myself the language.
I started with a Graph API but then chose to do a REST JSON API with Express instead.
The frontend is React. Starting this, I had no experience with React and this was a great way to learn.
I leverage AWS Cognito for Secure user Authentication.

## Testing
I have not setup a testing for this application at this time
